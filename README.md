# pseudo-code
A resource for people to use to learn how to program using pseudo-code.

I think it is important to learn how to think about code before writing it, hence this brief tutorial.

I hope I can get some feedback about how this can be improved, what can be expanded, and what topics can be added.
I would like to make this better and allow people in general to see that programming is not so mysterious, but just bigger problems broken down into smaller, simpler steps.
